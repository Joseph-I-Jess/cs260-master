Placeholder for a later syllabus file.
Syllabus should talk about approaches, breakdown of weights for a typical college offering for the materials in this repository.
The intent of materials, categories, various policy items, learning outcomes and other objectives should be outlined here; optionally a schedule will be provided (Joseph-I-Jess tends to include a brief one in a syllabus and a more detailed one as a separate document).
